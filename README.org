* Synopsis
This repository is the home of a [[file:calculator.js][very simple calculator]] that can be used [[file:index.html][on a website]].

It comes with a [[file:test.js][test suite]] functionality and a [[file:build.sh][build script]] that prepares the website for [[https://ci-example.netlify.app][its deploy]].

* Stages of this CI/CD Pipeline
Everytime the developer pushes a code change (one or more commits) to the git repository, a pipeline will be kicked off.

It contains multiple steps that will will run after each other.

** Stage 1: Test
Make sure that the calculator is free of defect by verifying different assertions using an automated test suite.
** Stage 2: Build
Automatically build a new version of the calculator that is ready for distribution.
** Stage 3: Release
Deploy a newly built version to the server that hosts the calculator.
* Files explained
** =calculator.js=
Contains the business logic for the calculator.

Right now, this is a simple function that adds two numbers and returns the sum.
** =test.js=
Represents the test suite for the calculator.

Multiple assertions ensure that the calculator is free of defects.
** =index.html=
Provides a user interface for the calculator in form of a website.
** =build.sh=
Builds a version of the calculator website that is ready for distribution and saves all necessary files in the =./dist= folder.
** =.github/workflows/pipeline.yml=
Defines the CI/CD pipeline of this repo in a GitHub actions compatible format.
* Next steps
To see the setup in action it might make sense to add another feature and/or fix a bug in the code.
